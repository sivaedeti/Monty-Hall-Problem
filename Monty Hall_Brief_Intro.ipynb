    "There are 3 doors, behind which are two goats and a car, the show and the shows host (Monty) knows where there is a goat and where there isn’t a goat and therefore knows which door the prize is behind. So, we are given three doors (Door A, Door B, and DoorC). You pick a door (call it door A).Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (B & C) and opens one with a goat. (If both doors have goats, he picks randomly.)\n",
    "The game goes like this after the host reveals one door the host asks:\"Do you stick with door A (original guess) or switch to the unopened door? Does it matter?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "the odds aren’t 50-50. If you switch doors you’ll win 2/3 of the time!\n",
